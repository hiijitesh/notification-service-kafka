# Scaling the Notification System

## What can be done in the future

### 1. Generalizing Consumers

-   Create flexible consumers that handle multiple topics dynamically.
-   Improves scalability and simplifies integration of new notification channels.

### 2. Partitioning Strategy

-   Shard Kafka partitions based on unique user attributes (e.g., `userId`).
-   Ensures even workload distribution and prevents bottlenecks.

### 3. Caching with Redis

-   Cache critical data like hourly notification limits.
-   Reduces database load and improves response time for frequent queries.

### 4. Horizontal Scaling

-   Scale producer and consumer instances dynamically using Kubernetes or Docker.
-   Handles traffic spikes efficiently and maintains performance.
