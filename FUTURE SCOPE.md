This section outlines potential enhancements to improve the notification system.

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Caching with Redis

-   Integrate Redis to cache user preferences and frequently accessed data.
-   Use Redis to store the count of notifications sent per user, allowing efficient checks for hourly limits.

### 2. Consumer Offset Management

-   Enable consumers to persist partition offsets.
-   Ensures seamless recovery and processing continuity during system restarts or failures.

### 3. Bulk SMS Processing

-   Implement a bulk SMS processing mechanism for handling high-volume SMS notifications.
-   Optimize throughput by batching messages and reducing individual processing overhead.

### 4. Advanced Scheduling

-   Add features for advanced scheduling, such as recurring notifications and user-specific delivery windows.

### 5. Multi-Tenant Support

-   Extend the system to support multi-tenancy, enabling multiple organizations to use the platform with isolated configurations.

### 6. AI-Powered Prioritization

-   Implementing AI/ML to dynamically prioritize notifications based on user behavior, channel performance, or urgency.

### 7. Enhanced Monitoring

-   Introduce real-time dashboards to track notification success rates, processing latency, and error trends.
-   Use predictive analytics to anticipate traffic surges and adjust scaling automatically.

These future improvements will enhance the systemâ€™s scalability, reliability, and user experience.
